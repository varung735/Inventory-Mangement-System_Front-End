# Inventory Management System

### <u>About Project</u>

This is a simple end-to-end closed appliaction which utilizes four simple CRUD operations. (Get, Post, Put, Delete). This web app keeps the data of the basic business operations which are Sales, Expenses, Inventory, Purchases, Stocks, Employees, their Salaries and lastly, Ledger.

The application is divided into two modules which are :-

 - Admin
 - Employee

Now, I'll let you know the powers of admin and that of the employees, briefly.

 1. ### <u>Admin</u>
    
    Admin will be able to perform CRUD operations on following modules:

    - Sales
    - Purchases
    - Inventory
    - Expenses
    - Stocks
    - Employees
    - Salaries
    - Ledger
 
 2. ### <u>Employee</u>

    Employee will be able to perform CRUD operations on following modules.

    - Sales
    - Purchase
    - Inventory
    - Expenses
    - Stocks

### <u>Technology Used</u>

 - React.js

### <u>Time Taken</u>

It took me around 3-4 months to build this project end-to-end.

### <u>Concepts Learned and Applied</u>
- React Hooks(useState, useEffect)
- Cookies (used js-cookies library to save cookies from frontend)
- Module CSS
- fetch API

### <u>Future Enchancements</u>

- The app has to be responsive
- After clicking on the button, the app takes some time to perform the operation. In order to fix this. The loading spinners will be added to avoid confusion.
- The alerts will be replaced by snack bars for the smoother operation.
- Currently, the same dummy image is used for the employees profile pic. So, new feature for uploading image is to be added.
- Will add active link in the side bar.
